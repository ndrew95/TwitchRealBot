# TwitchRealBot
This bot will interact with a chat channel, attempting to make users in the channel think it is a real person interacting with them.

After repeated use, this bot can interact with other users without other users thinking it is a bot. With brute-force, this bot can simulate messages which will align with the general sentiment of the chat.

This bot has used this brute-force method to interact with Twitch.tv users without them knowing it is a bot. The most potent example was during a World of Warcraft stream, when the streamer went from playing World of Warcraft: Battle For Azeroth to World of Warcraft: Classic.

After this stremer switched versions of World of Warcraft, the bot picked up that a lot of users sent messages containing the words "bfa," (short for Battle of Azeroth). and "Classic."

After seeing these messages, the bot asked "are you playing classic wow or BFA?" 

The streamer responded to the bot as if it was a real person asking the question.
