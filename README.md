# TwitchRealBot
This bot will interact with a chat channel, attempting to make users in the channel think it is a real person interacting with them.

After repeated use, this bot can interact with other users without other users thinking it is a bot. With brute-force, this bot can simulate messages which will align with the general sentiment of the chat.

This bot has used this brute-force method to interact with Twitch.tv users without them knowing it is a bot. The most potent example was during a World of Warcraft stream, when the streamer went from playing "World of Warcraft: Battle For Azeroth" to "World of Warcraft: Classic".

After this stremer switched versions of World of Warcraft, the bot picked up that a lot of users sent messages containing the words "bfa," (short for Battle of Azeroth). and "Classic."

After seeing these messages, the bot asked: "Are you playing classic wow, or BFA?"

The streamer responded to the bot as if it was a real person asking the question, saying: "Are you playing classic wow or BFA? Right now I'm just doing some classic, I was playing 3s for a while (referring to 3v3 arena in BFA). Dude, we kinda got *explicative* farmed for a while, bro. We got *explicative* farmed my boys.

The streamer's response to the bot can be seen in the .mov file in this repository.
